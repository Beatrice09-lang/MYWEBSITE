                    <li> Step1:Soak and then boil the dried beans in salted water until they are tender, which takes the longest time in preparation.  <br> </li> 
                    <li> Step2:Peel the sweet potatoes and steam them until soft.  Traditionally, the sweet potatoes are wrapped in banana leaves
                     for steaming, which imparts extra flavor.  <br></li> 
                    <li> Step3:Once cooked, mash the sweet potatoes thoroughly.   <br> </li> 
                    <li> Step4:Mix the mashed sweet potatoes gently with the cooked beans to form a uniform blend.  <br> </li> 
                    <li> Step5:Mugoyo is traditionally roasted or smoked to enhance its flavor, either by roasting wrapped in banana leaves 
                    over charcoal or placing it near smouldering fire embers(okubobeeza) for a smoky aroma.  <br> </li> 
                    <li> Step6:Serve mugoyo warm, typically as a hearty breakfast accompanied by black tea without milk or
                    sugar to compliment the dry texture of the dish.</li>
